🏦 Online Banking System (C Programming)
This project is a simple but fully functional Online Banking System built in C programming language.
It demonstrates core programming concepts including conditional statements, loops, functions, file handling, and a custom simple database system for persistent data storage.
📌 Features Implemented
1. User Registration
Creates a new account with:
Full name
Account number
Password
Initial deposit
Saved permanently in bank_database.db.
2. User Login
Authenticates using:
Account number
Password
Loads user profile from the database.
 3. Deposit Money
Adds funds to user balance
Updates database
Logs the transaction into transactions.db
4. Withdraw Money
Checks sufficient balance
Deducts amount from account
Updates database
Logs the withdrawal
 5. View Account Details
Displays:
Account holder name
Account number
Current balance
Password is never displayed.
 6. Transaction History
Shows all past transactions linked to the logged-in account
Stored in transactions.db, readable format:
ACC:12345 | Deposit | 200.00
ACC:12345 | Withdraw | 50.00
7. Simple Database System
Your project uses two database files:
bank_database.db
Stores account records in binary format
Supports:
INSERT
UPDATE
SELECT
 transactions.db
Stores each transaction in plain text
Easy for instructors to review
]Together, these act as a lightweight database system for the banking application.
Project Structure
online_banking_database.c    → Main program
bank_database.db             → Database of user accounts
transactions.db              → Transaction history log
README.md                    → Documentation
How to Compile and Run
Using GCC (Recommended)
gcc online_banking_database.c -o banking
./banking
Using CodeBlocks
1. Create a new C console project
2. Replace the main .c file with online_banking_database.c
3. Press Build & Run
Requirements
C Compiler (GCC, MinGW, or CodeBlocks)
No external libraries required
Works on Windows, Linux, and Mac
 Extra Features Added (Bonus Marks)
Transaction history
Simple database implementation
Persistent storage
File-based account updates
Clean menu navigation
 Assumptions
Each account number is unique
No concurrent access to the database
Passwords stored in plain text (can be upgraded to hashing if needed)
⚠️ Limitations
No encryption on stored data
No admin panel (can be added on request)
No protection against malformed database files
Possible Future Improvements
I can help you add:
 Password hashing (SHA-256)
 Fund transfer between accounts
 Admin dashboard
Export reports
 Colored UI with animations
